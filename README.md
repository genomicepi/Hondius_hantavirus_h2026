## Data
We are curating four kinds of data. The first is a line list of suspected/confirmed cases. This line list pulls from publicly available sources and provides key metadata for each case. The second is a list of known exposures. These exposures were curated using an agentic workflow that we call episource. The third are sequencing data from the current outbreak. Currently, this is just a single sequence provided by the Swiss National Reference Center for Emerging Viral Infections, Geneva University Hospitals and the Institute of Medical Virology, University of Zurich. Finally, a set of news article that were sourced from https://www.mediacloud.org/ and then extracted and structured using the episource agentic workflow.
